                <h1 class="">I Am Sam</h1>
                <p> For the past 14 years, I have been working in the memorial masonry industry where I have honed
                    my attention to detail and craftsmanship through to creating meaningful tributes for those who have
                    lost those near to them. However, my
                    passion for technology and design has led me to embark on new journey into the world of
                    tech. <br>
                    I have taught myself the basics of web-development and I have recently signed up for a Web/Software
                    Developer boot camp led by <a target="_blank" href="https://thecodersguild.org.uk/"> The Coders
                        Guild</a> where I
                    will hone my existing skill set and build on the knowledge I already have.

                <p>I have created three simple web-apps that bring together my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

                        <p>One of my projects is a Magic 8 Ball web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It
                            emulates the classic fortune-telling toy by generating random answers to user questions. It
                            was an engaging project that allowed me to practice JavaScript logic and user interaction

                        <p>Another project in my portfolio is a Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and
                            JavaScript. It offers a fun and interactive gaming experience played locally with an
                            opponent. This
                            project enabled me to enhance my understanding of game logic and DOM manipulation

                <h1 class="title-right">Going forward</h1>
                <p> Moving forward with my journey into tech, I wish to build upon my existing knowledge of HTML, CSS,
                    and JavaScript whilst committing some time to learning jQuery and React to further enhance my skills
                    (hence the blur above)</p>
                <p>I recognize the power and versatility of jQuery in simplifying DOM manipulation and enhancing user
                    interactions. By getting to grips with jQuery, I aim to create more dynamic and interactive web
                    experiences.</p>
                <p>By gaining proficiency in React, I aim to create robust, responsive, and feature-rich web
                    applications</p>
                <p>I am passionate about continuously learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies, and
                    I believe that mastering jQuery and React will further enhance my ability to create engaging and
                    user-friendly web experiences.</p>
                <p>All of the above should be obtainable through commitment to the bootcamp I start on the 5th June</p>
