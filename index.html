                <h1 class="title-left">I Am Sam</h1>
                <p> For the past 14 years, I have been working in the memorial masonry industry where I have honed
                    my attention to detail and craftsmanship through to creating meaningful tributes for those who have
                    lost those near to them. However, my
                    passion for technology and design has led me to embark on new journey into the world of
                    tech. <br>
                    I have taught myself the basics of web-development and I have recently signed up for a Web/Software
                    Developer boot camp led by <a target="_blank" href="https://thecodersguild.org.uk/"> The Coders
                        Guild</a> where I
                    will hone my existing skill set and build on the knowledge I already have.

                <p> I have created three simple web-apps that bring together my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

                        <p>One of my projects is a Magic 8 Ball web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It
                            emulates the classic fortune-telling toy by generating random answers to user questions. It
                            was an engaging project that allowed me to practice JavaScript logic and user interaction

                        <p>Another project in my portfolio is a Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and
                            JavaScript. It offers a fun and interactive gaming experience with a computer opponent. This
                            project enabled me to enhance my understanding of game logic and DOM manipulation</p>

                        <p> I created a Headstone Creator web app utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This unique
                            project allows users to customize virtual headstones with personalized text and designs. It
                            showcases my creativity, attention to detail, and ability to implement user-friendly
